hedge: Any linguistic device by which a speaker avoids being compromised by a statement that turns out to be wrong, a request that is not acceptable, and so on. Thus, instead of saying 'This argument is convincing', one might use a hedge and say 'As far as I can see this argument is convincing'; instead of simply giving an order 'Carry it into the kitchen!' one might use an interrogative as a hedge and say 'Could you perhaps carry it into the kitchen?'
